# MySQL Learning Log and Practice Repository

This repository serves as a personal learning log and version controlled archive of all the lessons, exercises and practice files I completed while learning MySQL. Every file, commit and timestamp reflects my actual study progression as I worked through the material.

## Course Information

I enrolled in the Data Analyst Course on AnalystBuilder.com, created by Alex The Analyst.

Creator: Alex The Analyst  
YouTube Channel: [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)  
Platform: [AnalystBuilder.com] (paid course)  

Although Alex provides a large amount of free SQL and analytics content on YouTube, the material there is not fully structured or organized in a clear progression. Because of that, I chose to take the paid version of the course on AnalystBuilder.com. The content is well organized, includes exercises and provides a more systematic approach for learning SQL from the basics to more advanced concepts.
